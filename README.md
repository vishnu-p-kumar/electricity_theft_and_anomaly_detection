## 1. Project Summary

At a high level, the project does five things:

1. Generates hourly synthetic smart-meter data for Bengaluru areas.
2. Simulates electricity theft, anomalies, energy wastage, weather effects, and pole-level tampering.
3. Trains anomaly detection, theft detection, and demand forecasting models.
4. Replays a live simulation through a FastAPI backend that updates every few seconds.
5. Visualizes current and historical analytics in a static dashboard.

The repository is meter-centric but also includes a pole-monitoring layer. Each meter is mapped into a `transformer -> pole -> meter` hierarchy, allowing the system to detect direct pole tapping, supply mismatch, and hidden unmetered consumption in addition to meter-level suspicious behavior.

## 2. Key Capabilities

- Synthetic smart-meter generation across multiple Bengaluru areas
- Weather-aware electricity consumption simulation
- Multiple theft scenarios such as bypass, tampering, illegal connections, and abnormal spikes
- Isolation Forest based anomaly detection
- Random Forest plus boosted-model theft classification
- Theft probability calibration using anomaly, wastage, and seeded theft context
- Meter-level risk scoring and risk categories
- Energy efficiency and wastage analytics
- Pole energy balance monitoring and pole tamper detection
- LSTM and Transformer-based demand forecasting with fallback behavior
- Data drift monitoring between historical and recent windows
- Explainable predictions for suspicious meters
- Optional alert dispatch to email, Slack, and Telegram
- FastAPI REST API plus WebSocket live stream
- Multi-section static dashboard for realtime monitoring and artifact downloads

## 3. System Architecture

The current implementation follows this flow:

1. `run_project.py` loads generation defaults from `utils/helpers.py`.
2. `src/data_generator.py` creates:
   - the main dataset
   - a sampled training dataset
   - a live simulation dataset
   - meter and pole catalogs
   - generation summary metadata
3. `src/train_models.py` trains:
   - Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
   - Random Forest for theft detection
   - XGBoost or a fallback boosted model for theft detection
   - LSTM demand forecaster
   - Transformer demand forecaster
4. `api/main.py` boots the runtime, regenerates missing artifacts when needed, loads models and datasets, and starts a simulation loop.
5. Each live tick is enriched with anomaly scores, theft probabilities, risk levels, efficiency metrics, pole energy balance, drift state, clustering output, and forecast output.
6. Runtime snapshots are written into SQLite tables in `database/meter_data.db`.
7. The dashboard reads API endpoints every few seconds and can also consume the `/ws/live` WebSocket payload.

## 5. Data Generation Pipeline

The synthetic data generator is implemented in `src/data_generator.py`.

### 5.1 Geographic Coverage

Meters are distributed across Bengaluru locations defined in `utils/helpers.py`:

- Whitefield
- Electronic City
- Indiranagar
- Koramangala
- Marathahalli
- Yelahanka
- BTM Layout
- Jayanagar
- Malleshwaram
- Rajajinagar
- Hebbal
- Bellandur
- HSR Layout
- Banashankari
- Peenya Industrial Area

Coordinates are jittered around each area center so meters appear spatially distinct on the map while still staying inside Bengaluru bounds.

### 5.2 Usage Profiles

Every meter is assigned a usage profile that drives base load behavior:

- `residential`
- `night_usage`
- `industrial`
- `ac_heavy`
- `commercial`

These profiles influence load shape, temperature sensitivity, weekday/weekend patterns, and expected consumption.

### 5.3 Weather Generation

Weather is handled by `src/weather_api.py`.

Behavior:

- If `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` is configured, the weather service can fetch current live weather from OpenWeather.
- For historical generation and fallback scenarios, the project simulates Bengaluru hourly weather.

Generated weather fields include:

- `temperature`
- `humidity`
- `rainfall`
- `wind_speed`
- `weather_condition`

### 5.4 Theft Scenarios

The dataset simulates these theft patterns:

- `meter_bypass`
- `abnormal_spikes`
- `constant_low_consumption`
- `illegal_connection`
- `tampered_meter`

These patterns modify reported consumption, actual load, voltage, current behavior, and downstream risk signals.

### 5.5 Pole Hierarchy

The project extends the meter dataset with:

- `transformer_id`
- `pole_id`
- `connected_meters`

The pole hierarchy is generated automatically and stored in `data/processed/pole_catalog.csv`. This enables pole-level supply simulation and tamper detection during runtime.

### 5.6 Default Generation Settings

`utils/helpers.py` defines two standard configurations.

Default mode:

- `num_meters = 500`
- `days = 60`
- `chunk_size = 45`
- `sample_rows = 45000`
- `simulation_days = 10`
- `simulation_meter_limit = 425`
- `seed = 42`

Full-scale mode:

- `num_meters = 1000`
- `days = 365`
- `chunk_size = 100`
- `sample_rows = 120000`
- `simulation_days = 14`
- `simulation_meter_limit = 80`
- `seed = 42`

### 5.7 Live Simulation Stability

The live replay dataset intentionally behaves differently from the broader historical training data:

- a deterministic subset of live meters is selected as theft candidates
- the selected live theft meters remain stable during the live replay window
- non-selected live meters can have random theft disabled during replay

This keeps the dashboard easier to follow during presentations because the suspicious meters do not jump randomly every few seconds.

## 6. Dataset Schema

## 8. Runtime and API Behavior

The backend lives in `api/main.py`.

### 8.1 Startup Behavior

On startup the runtime:

1. ensures project directories exist
2. regenerates data artifacts if key files are missing or outdated
3. retrains models if required model artifacts are missing
4. loads historical and live datasets
5. initializes forecast, drift, and pole-monitoring state
6. advances one simulation tick immediately so the dashboard has data at first load

### 8.2 Live Tick Processing

Every update cycle:

1. the runtime selects one timestamp slice from `live_simulation.csv`
2. meter readings are classified for anomaly and theft
3. a visible theft candidate may be injected if none is present
4. the first detected theft meter can be kept sticky for demo stability
5. theft alerts are capped for readability
6. risk and efficiency metrics are computed
7. pole energy is simulated and checked for tampering
8. recent windows are updated for drift monitoring
9. forecast data is rebuilt
10. SQLite tables are refreshed
11. the latest snapshot is broadcast to WebSocket clients
12. periodic reports and heatmap outputs are regenerated on schedule

### 8.3 SQLite Tables

The backend writes runtime data into `database/meter_data.db` using tables such as:

- `meter_readings`
- `live_predictions`
- `recent_predictions`
- `risk_scores`
- `efficiency_metrics`
- `drift_reports`
- `forecast_snapshots`
- `pole_energy_data`
- `pole_tamper_events`

### 8.4 Alert Integrations

`src/alert_engine.py` supports optional outbound alert delivery through:

- SMTP email
- Slack webhook
- Telegram bot API

Alerts are sent only when `SMARTGRID_ENABLE_ALERTS=1`.

## 9. Dashboard

The frontend is a static dashboard in `dashboard/`.

Main files:

- `dashboard/index.html`
- `dashboard/main.js`
- `dashboard/style.css`

Shared components:

- `dashboard/components/core.js`
- `dashboard/components/charts.js`
- `dashboard/components/alerts.js`
- `dashboard/components/forecast.js`
- `dashboard/components/heatmap.js`

The dashboard defaults to the API base URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and stores UI state such as selected section and theme in local storage.

### 9.1 Dashboard Sections

Each file in `dashboard/sections/` represents one analytics view:

- `overview.html`
  High-level KPIs, live demand, and system health.

- `live_monitoring.html`
  Realtime usage and meter-level monitoring.

## 19. Presentation Summary

This project simulates a Bengaluru smart-grid intelligence platform. It generates synthetic smart-meter data with weather, theft, anomaly, wastage, and pole-level tamper behavior; trains multiple ML models; replays the data as a live FastAPI stream; stores runtime snapshots in SQLite; and visualizes the full monitoring workflow in a multi-section dashboard. The result is a complete demonstration of electricity theft detection, anomaly monitoring, energy efficiency analysis, demand forecasting, weather impact analysis, drift detection, and pole tamper surveillance.

## 20. Detailed Model Selection Rationale

This project does not use only one model because the problem is not only one machine learning task. Electricity theft detection involves abnormal-pattern discovery, supervised theft classification, demand forecasting, risk ranking, pole-level energy-balance analysis, explainability, and drift monitoring. Each part has a different data shape and operational goal.

### 20.1 Models Actually Used

| Project Need | Model or Method Used | Main File | Why It Is Used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Meter anomaly detection | Isolation Forest | `src/train_models.py`, `src/detect_anomaly.py` | Detects rare or unusual meter behavior without needing every possible theft pattern to be labelled. |
| Theft classification | Random Forest Classifier | `src/train_models.py`, `src/theft_detector.py` | Strong, stable model for structured tabular data; handles nonlinear rules and mixed feature interactions well. |
| Theft classification | XGBoost Classifier | `src/train_models.py`, `src/theft_detector.py` | Boosted trees usually perform well on fraud-like structured data and can capture sharp decision boundaries. |
| Theft classification fallback | HistGradientBoostingClassifier | `src/train_models.py` | Keeps the pipeline working even if the `xgboost` package is unavailable. |
| Demand forecasting | LSTM | `src/demand_forecasting.py` | Learns sequential consumption behavior such as hourly and daily demand cycles. |
| Demand forecasting | Transformer Regressor | `src/transformer_forecasting.py` | Provides an advanced time-series model that can learn longer-range temporal relationships. |
| Forecast fallback | Seasonal baseline forecaster | `src/demand_forecasting.py`, `src/transformer_forecasting.py` | Keeps forecast APIs and dashboards functional even when deep learning libraries or trained artifacts are missing. |
| Pole tamper detection | Isolation Forest plus energy-balance heuristics | `src/pole_tamper_detector.py` | Detects abnormal pole-level energy mismatch, hidden load, and possible illegal connections. |
| Risk ranking | Weighted risk scoring | `src/risk_scoring.py` | Converts model outputs and electrical signals into an operational priority score. |
| Explainability | SHAP or fallback feature importance | `src/explainable_ai.py` | Explains why a meter is suspicious, which is important for inspector decisions. |
| Drift monitoring | Evidently or fallback statistical drift checks | `src/data_drift_monitor.py` | Checks whether live data has shifted away from historical training data. |
| Hyperparameter tuning | Optuna | `src/model_optimizer.py` | Optionally searches better parameters for Isolation Forest, Random Forest, and XGBoost. |

### 20.2 Why Isolation Forest Was Chosen

Isolation Forest is used for anomaly detection because theft and electrical faults are rare compared with normal readings. The model works by isolating unusual points faster than common points. In this project, it is trained mainly on normal records and produces an `anomaly_score`. A high score means the reading behaves differently from the learned normal pattern.

It is useful here because not every real theft case will look exactly like the synthetic labels. For example, a meter bypass, voltage drop, power-factor issue, and unusual night usage may appear in different combinations. Isolation Forest gives the system a way to flag suspicious readings even before the supervised classifier is fully confident.

Why not only Isolation Forest:

- It is unsupervised, so it does not directly learn the difference between theft, wastage, and harmless unusual demand.
- It can flag genuine high consumption as anomalous.
- It gives anomaly evidence, but it is not enough for final theft classification.

### 20.3 Why Random Forest Was Chosen

Random Forest is used as a supervised theft classifier because the dataset contains labelled `is_theft` examples generated from known theft scenarios. It works well with tabular features such as voltage, current, consumption, power factor, weather, usage profile, area, rolling averages, night usage ratio, and wastage score.

It was chosen because:

- it is robust on tabular data
- it handles nonlinear relationships
- it is less sensitive to feature scaling
- it gives reliable baseline performance
- it can handle noisy synthetic data better than a single decision tree
- it supports class balancing with `class_weight="balanced_subsample"`

Why not only Random Forest:

- Boosted models often provide better probability separation on fraud-style tabular data.
- Random Forest may average many trees and become less sharp near difficult boundaries.
- It may be less efficient than boosting when the goal is high recall on rare suspicious events.

### 20.4 Why XGBoost Was Chosen

XGBoost is used as the stronger boosted theft classifier. It trains trees sequentially, where each new tree focuses on errors from previous trees. This is useful in theft detection because the suspicious class may be rare, and important patterns may depend on feature interactions.

It was chosen because:

- it performs very well on structured/tabular ML problems
- it can capture complex theft signatures
- it usually gives strong ranking probabilities
- it handles mixed signal strength better than simple linear models
- it is common in fraud detection, credit risk, and anomaly-heavy classification

Why a fallback model is included:

The project should still run on machines where XGBoost is not installed. In that case, `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` is used as a scikit-learn fallback. The saved artifact path remains `models/xgboost_model.pkl`, but the metadata records whether the actual model is `xgboost` or `hist_gradient_boosting_fallback`.

### 20.5 Why Random Forest and XGBoost Are Combined

The final theft probability is not taken from only one classifier. In `src/theft_detector.py`, the project blends the probabilities:

```text
blended_probability = 0.45 * random_forest_probability + 0.55 * xgboost_probability
```

Then the project calibrates the final score using:

- blended supervised model probability
- seeded theft probability from the generator
- anomaly score
- wastage score

The calibration formula gives most weight to the supervised models, while still allowing anomaly and wastage signals to raise suspicion. Strong evidence can push final `theft_probability` above `0.91`, which maps to `Electricity Theft`.

This design was chosen because a practical theft system should not depend on one signal. A meter may be suspicious because of model confidence, abnormal usage, wastage, voltage irregularity, or seeded theft behavior in the live demo.

### 20.6 Why LSTM Was Chosen for Forecasting

Electricity demand is time-series data. Hourly consumption depends on previous hours, time of day, day of week, weather, and usage profile. LSTM is designed to learn sequential patterns and can remember context over a lookback window.

In this project:

- readings are grouped by timestamp
- total consumption is converted into a demand series
- the model uses a 24-hour lookback window
- it predicts future values recursively
- outputs are summarized as next hour, next day, and next week

Why not only a statistical model:

Simple methods like moving average or ARIMA are easier to explain, but they may struggle when demand behavior is nonlinear and influenced by weather, area mix, and usage profile changes.

### 20.7 Why Transformer Forecasting Was Added

The Transformer forecaster gives a second advanced forecasting approach. Unlike LSTM, a Transformer encoder can learn relationships across positions in the input sequence using attention. In this project it is intentionally compact, CPU-friendly, and used for comparison rather than as a huge deep learning model.

It was chosen because:

- it represents a modern time-series modeling approach
- it can learn longer temporal relationships
- it gives a useful comparison against LSTM
- it makes the forecasting module more complete for academic explanation

Why not only Transformer:

- it may need more data to outperform simpler methods
- it depends on PyTorch availability
- it is less straightforward to explain than LSTM or tree models
- for a small demo dataset, a baseline may sometimes be more stable

### 20.8 Why Baseline Fallbacks Are Important

The project includes fallback behavior intentionally. If TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, SHAP, Evidently, or Optuna is unavailable, the system should still run.

Fallbacks are important because:

- project demos should not fail due to optional library installation issues
- API endpoints should keep returning valid payloads
- dashboards should remain usable
- tests can validate behavior without requiring every heavy dependency
- users can run the core project on normal laptops

### 20.9 Other Models That Could Be Used

The following models are possible alternatives or future improvements.

| Model | Where It Could Be Used | Why It Could Help | Why It Was Not the Main Choice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | Theft classification | Simple, interpretable baseline | Too linear for complex theft patterns. |
| Decision Tree | Theft classification | Easy to visualize and explain | Overfits easily and is weaker than Random Forest. |
| Support Vector Machine | Theft classification/anomaly | Can work well on smaller datasets | Scaling and probability calibration are harder for large tabular streams. |
| KNN | Anomaly or theft classification | Simple distance-based reasoning | Slow at prediction time and sensitive to scaling. |
| Naive Bayes | Baseline classification | Fast and simple | Feature independence assumption is unrealistic for electrical data. |
| CatBoost | Theft classification | Excellent for categorical tabular features | Adds another external dependency; XGBoost is already common and available. |
| LightGBM | Theft classification | Very fast gradient boosting | Another dependency; XGBoost/scikit fallback is enough for this project. |
| Autoencoder | Anomaly detection | Learns compressed normal behavior | Needs neural-network training and tuning; less interpretable than Isolation Forest. |
| One-Class SVM | Anomaly detection | Classic one-class anomaly method | Can be slow and sensitive to kernel/scaling choices. |
| Local Outlier Factor | Anomaly detection | Good for local density anomalies | Less convenient for stable deployed prediction on new streaming points. |
| ARIMA/SARIMA | Demand forecasting | Strong classical time-series baseline | Less flexible for nonlinear effects and multiple external signals. |
| Prophet | Demand forecasting | Good trend/seasonality decomposition | Extra dependency and less aligned with custom deep learning comparison. |
| GRU | Demand forecasting | Lighter alternative to LSTM | Similar purpose; LSTM is more commonly explained in coursework. |
| Temporal CNN | Demand forecasting | Fast sequence modeling | Less familiar for many interview explanations. |
| Graph Neural Network | Grid/pole topology modeling | Could model transformer-pole-meter relationships directly | More complex and not necessary for this demo scale. |

### 20.10 Did This Project Choose Only One Model?

No. The project uses a multi-model approach:

- Isolation Forest finds unusual meter behavior.
- Random Forest learns labelled theft patterns.
- XGBoost or HistGradientBoosting improves supervised theft scoring.
- LSTM forecasts future demand.
- Transformer forecasting provides an advanced comparison model.
- Pole tamper detection combines energy-balance rules with Isolation Forest.
- Risk scoring blends model outputs into operational severity.

The main theft decision is therefore not based on a single model. It is an ensemble-style decision supported by anomaly detection, supervised classification, seeded theft context, wastage score, and risk scoring.

### 20.11 Final Model Decision Summary

The selected models are appropriate because the project uses structured smart-meter data, rare-event theft labels, time-series demand behavior, and operational dashboard requirements.

- For anomaly detection, Isolation Forest is simple, fast, and suitable for rare abnormal readings.
- For theft classification, Random Forest gives robustness and XGBoost gives stronger boosted performance.
- For forecasting, LSTM and Transformer models match the sequential nature of electricity demand.
- For deployment reliability, fallback models keep the system usable even when optional ML libraries are missing.
- For real-world usefulness, explainability, drift monitoring, and risk scoring turn raw predictions into inspection-ready information.
